# Ansible_Refactoring_Static_Assignment

##Deployment and configuration of UAT Web Servers using Ansible imports and roles

In this project we will continue working with "ansible-config-mgt" repository and some improvements will be made
to the code.We will refactor our existing Ansible code,create assignments, then deploy and configure UAT Web Servers using Ansible imports and roles. 
The ansible Imports will allow effective re-use  of previously created playbooks in a new playbook and also allows the
organization of tasks and reuse when needed.


The overall architecture is as shown below.
